## 🎓 About This Repository

This repository serves as a **preparation hub for Polytechnic students** appearing for their Java Programming semester final exams. It contains solved practical problems, standard algorithms, and core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples often asked in board exams and lab finals.

I have uploaded these codes to help my fellow students understand the logic and syntax required to score well in the practical and theory sections.

## 📂 Study Topics & File Guide

### 🔹 Module 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Essential concepts for the written and practical exams.

| Concept | File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inheritance** | `Multilevel_Inheritance.java` | Example of Multilevel Inheritance (First -> Second -> Third). |
| **Polymorphism** | `Overloading.java` | Compile-time polymorphism showing method overloading (adding 2 vs 3 numbers). |
| **Overriding** | `OverriddenMethod.java` | Runtime polymorphism showing how a subclass overrides a parent method. |
| **Constructors** | `ConstructorMethod.java` | Basic constructor usage to initialize student data (Roll, Mark, Name). |
| **Copy Constructor** | `CopyConstructor.java` | Advanced concept showing how to copy object data (Rectangle dimensions) to a new object. |

### 🔹 Module 2: Logic & Algorithms
Common logical problems asked in practical vivas.

| Concept | File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prime Numbers** | `PrimeNumber.java` | Logic to find prime numbers within a range (2 to 25) using nested loops. |
| **Conditionals** | `FindLargestNumber.java` | Logic to find the largest of three numbers using `if-else` blocks. |
| **Modulo Operator** | `EvenOdd.java` | Simple program to check if a user-input number is Even or Odd. |

### 🔹 Module 3: Basic Calculations & Loops
Fundamental syntax practice.

| Concept | File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Geometry** | `CircleArea.java` | Calculates the area of a circle taking radius input from the user. |
| **Loops** | `JavaApplication5.java` | Demonstrates a decrementing `for` loop (20, 18, 16... down to 6). |
